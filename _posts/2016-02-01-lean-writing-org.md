Lean Writing is up, running and available for expressing your lean ideas to the
Internet.

This site and related subdomains are easily creatable and updateable for contriubutions by members of the lean-writing github community.

By using a combination of github, git, and static web content; Lean Writing can
act as a playground for:

* A home for blogs
* A repository to easily allow for collaboration and sharing of lean writing
* And much more... It's a blank slate, and it's here for you!
