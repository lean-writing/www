Lean Writing is a 'work in process'.  It allows people wanting to develop,
collaborate and share ideas in a better way:


## Minimal Environment

## Immediate Updates

## Easy Collaboration

* Sharing: Authors can publish content instantly!
* Collaborating: Writers can share ideas, live on the web, and work with others
in the form of sharing
